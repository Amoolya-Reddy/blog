      <h4>Mohammad Sadoghi</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="item__description">
      <p>Sadoghi's research spans all facets of secure and massive-scale data management. He leads the ExpoLab research group with the aim to pioneer a resilient data platform at scale, a distributed ledger centered around a democratic and decentralized computational model (Blockchain Textbook, ResilientDB Fabric, Journey, Outlook/Slides, Talk/Slides, Bitcoin Radio, Code, Hands-on, Wiki) that further aims to unify secure transactional and real-time analytical processing (Transaction Textbook, L-Store, QueCC). We envision ResilientDB to serve as a platform to foster "creativity". He has co-founded a blockchain company called Moka Blox, a spin-off of our ResilientDB Fabric.</p>
