# What is ResView

ResView is a tool for visualizing the PBFT process in Resilient DB. ResView is built on top of  Resilient DB and gathers statistics from transactions to display in graphical form. Currently, ResView works on local instances of Resilient DB, but can be used for deployed instances with some changes to Websockets and connections.

Below is a diagram showing the workflow of ResView and the high-level structure:

## Interfacing with ResilientDB

ResView offers both ways to interact with the ResilientDB architecture, as well as ways to visualize what is occurring in ResilientDB. Users are able to interact with ResilientDB through the application using the transaction forms and "make a replica faulty" buttons. Within the transaction forms, users select whether they want to perform a SET or GET transaction and input the data fields accordingly, key & value or just key. Once this transaction is confirmed, it is sent via Axios to the sdk, which verifies the transaction and forwards it to the ReslientDB backend, where it is then processed and executed. 

For the faulty buttons, when these are pressed, they send a signal to the corresponding the replica informing it to reject any transactions it receives, simulating a replica unable to receive messages. Before this addition, there was no method of forcing a replica to be faulty, making this a valuable addition for testing various cases and potential situations ResilientDB could face.

## Data Collection


## Viewing the Data

# Prerequisites

Before running the ResView application, you need to start kv service on the ResDB backend and the sdk.

## resilientdb
Git clone the ResView backend repository and follow the instructions to set it up:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saipranav-Kotamreddy/ResView
```
Setup KV Service:
```bash
./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh
```

## sdk
Git clone the GraphQL Repository and follow the instructions on the ReadMe to set it up:

Install GraphQL:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResilientDB-GraphQL
```

Setup SDK:
```bash
bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/service.config service/http_server/server_config.config
```

With these 2 services running, the ResView front end can now send transactions to the ResDB framework

## Setting up the ResView Application

Clone the repo and open in a new folder.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the below code to start the app and load the script.

```bash
npm run start
```
# Using the ResView Application

Once ResView has been started, go to http://localhost:3000/pages/visualizer

Once on this page, there are 3 tabs: Transaction Form; PBFT Diagram; and Messages vs Time

Load KV_Service on resilient db once on the visualizer page, the web sockets are connected when the 
"OPEN" message is printed 4 times.

Use the transaction form to send transactions to the sdk, whether SET or GET transactions.

    </em>
</p>

Once the transaction has been sent and the data has been collected, the console will show the raw JSON containing the responses from all the replicas. This data is then visualized in the PBFT diagram and the Message versus Time graphs. When multiple transactions have been sent, the user can choose which transaction to display in the graphs via the choose transaction option.

Once the user clicks on the PBFT graph, they are provided a diagram reconstructing the consensus process as it occurred in the resilientdb backend. This diagram is built using the data retrieved, and so is accurate to the primary and status of each replica. Users can also view timestamps of replicas at certain phases as well.

The user also has access to Message versus Time graphs, which display the rate at which each replica gathered Prepare and Commit messages during consensus. This is useful to see which replicas could collect messages faster, if there were periods where all replicas collected messages, if some replicas collected less messages than others, and more. Users can also toggle which replicas are being displayed on this graph to isolate analysis to specific replicas. Users can also interact with "Make Faulty" buttons to test their next transaction with some replicas being faulty.

# Future Work

Fixing a bug with View Change which is inconsistent on the backend, as setting multiple replicas to be faulty simultaneously causes resilientdb to start producing errors.

Add a diagram to see view changes and how they function

Allowing users to see transaction's command, key, and value before selecting which one to view

Allow users to dynamically scale resilientdb to different replica amounts to simulate larger networks

Set up ResView on Cloud Instance to retrieve far more transaction data

Store transaction information between Application instances to avoid data loss
