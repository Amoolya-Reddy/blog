ResVault is a chrome extension that serves as a wallet for ResilientDB. The wallet allows you to commit and retrieve data from ResilientDB and provides user account creation and deletion. It communicates with ResilientDB using the NexRes GraphQL server and enables transaction logging.

# Prerequisites
### Setup Python3.10
Ensure you have Python3.10, otherwise download it and set it up as default.
- Check with:
  > python3 --version

### Setup ResilientDB
- You will need to clone the ResilientDB repo to get started:
  > git clone https://github.com/resilientdb/resilientdb.git

- Then navigate inside the ResilientDB directory:
  > cd resilientdb

- Install Bazel:
  > echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
  > curl https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  > sudo apt update
  > sudo apt install bazel

- Install dependencies:
  > sh INSTALL.sh

- Run ResilientDB KV Service:
  > ./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh

### Setup Crow HTTP server, SDK, and GraphQL server
- You will need to clone the NexRes GraphQL repo to get started:
  > git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/NexresGraphQL.git

- Then navigate inside the NexResGraphQL directory:
  > cd NexresGraphQL

- Install the Crow dependencies:
  > sudo apt update
  > sudo apt install build-essential
  > sudo apt install python3.10-dev
  > sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl gnupg

- Build Crow HTTP server:
  > bazel build service/http_server:crow_service_main

- Start the Crow HTTP server:
  > bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/service.config service/http_server/server_config.config

- Create virtual environment for the Python SDK:
  > python3 -m venv venv --without-pip

- Activate the virtual environment:
  > source venv/bin/activate

- Install pip in the virtual environment for the Python dependencies:
  > curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python

- Install the Python dependencies:
  > pip install -r requirements.txt

- Start the GraphQL server.
  > python3 app.py

# Setup Wallet
### Build from source code
You can generate the wallet build using the ResVault source code. To do this:
- Download NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and ensure that it's added to PATH.

- Clone the ResVault repo to get started:
  > git clone https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResVault.git

- Then navigate inside the ResVault directory:
  > cd ResVault

- Install the dependencies.
  > npm install

- Build the wallet.
  > npm run build

- You will see the following message if build was successful: 
  ```
    The build folder is ready to be deployed.
    You may serve it with a static server:

    serve -s build

    Find out more about deployment here:

    https://cra.link/deployment
  ```
- The build will now be available in `build` directory inside the ResVault directory.

### Add build to chrome
Once you have generated the build:
- Open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

- Make sure developer mode is enabled using the toggle button.

- Finally, load the extension by clicking on load unpacked button and then select the `build` folder that was created in the previous step.

- Now you can open the wallet from the extension button and start using it!

### Add release to chrome
Alternatively, you can use the release from the ResVault repo instead of generating your own build. To do this:

- Download the latest build.zip from [here](https://github.com/ResilientApp/ResVault/releases).

- Extract the contents in a new directory.

- Open chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`

- Make sure developer mode is enabled using the toggle button.

- Finally, load the extension by clicking on load unpacked button and then select the directory where you extracted the contents previously.

- Now you can open the wallet from the extension button and start using it!

# Usage
In order to use the ResVault chrome extension ensure that you have KV service, Crow HTTP server, and NexRes GraphQL server running in the terminal windows:

- One terminal window should run: `bazel-bin/service/http_server/crow_service_main service/tools/config/interface/service.config service/http_server/server_config.config` after navigating inside the NexResGraphQL directory.

- The other terminal window should run: `./service/tools/kv/server_tools/start_kv_service.sh` after navigating inside the ResilientDB directory.

- The final terminal window should run: `python3 app.py` after navigating inside the NexResGraphQL directory. 

### GraphQL playground
Additionally, you can also experiment with the deployed instance of ResilientDB on <a href="https://cloud.resilientdb.com/graphql">https://cloud.resilientdb.com/graphql</a>
