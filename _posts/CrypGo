# How does CrypGo work?

CrypGo is directly connected to the Python SDK which is connected to the Crow HTTPS server which communicates with ResilientDB. Our Application runs similar to how ResVault works.

# Running the Application

## Installing and Setting Up the Expo Go App

Install the Expo Go App from the App Store.
Expo Go is an application for iOS and Android that allows developers to quickly preview and test React Native apps on mobile devices during development. It connects with the Expo CLI to load up projects instantly, streamlining the development process by enabling live coding and debugging directly on a smartphone or tablet.

## Running the App - CrypGo
### Installing and Setting Up Xcode
1. Navigate and Download to Xcode on the App Store on your iOs laptop devices.
2. Download the required packages for your designated mobile and laptop.

### Creating a New ReactNative Project
1. Fork from our repository and then run the following command on an IDE:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
    The command used in the Node.js environment to install packages from the Node Package Manager (npm) registry. It reads the package.json file in the current directory to automatically install all the dependencies listed there, allowing developers to easily manage and share packages across different projects.

2. Navigate to the Frontend file using this command:
   ```
   cd Frontend/
   ```

### Running the Expo Simulator App 
1. Simply type this command:
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```
2. Since we are an iOS app, select "i":
   ```
   i
   ```

    You are now all set to use the CrypGo App. With the CrypGo App now installed, you're ready to embark on a seamless cryptocurrency tracking experience.

# Conclusion
