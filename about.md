> The Exploratory System Laboratory aims at Making Permissioned Blockchain Systems *Fast Again*.

ResilientDB makes system-centric design decisions by adopting a multi-thread architecture that encompasses deep-pipelines. Further, we separate the ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows us to perform out-of-order processing of messages.

      <p>Sadoghi's research spans all facets of secure and massive-scale data management. He leads the ExpoLab research group with the aim to pioneer a resilient data platform at scale, a distributed ledger centered around a democratic and decentralized computational model (Blockchain Textbook, ResilientDB Fabric, Journey, Outlook/Slides, Talk/Slides, Bitcoin Radio, Code, Hands-on, Wiki) that further aims to unify secure transactional and real-time analytical processing (Transaction Textbook, L-Store, QueCC). We envision ResilientDB to serve as a platform to foster "creativity". He has co-founded a blockchain company called Moka Blox, a spin-off of our ResilientDB Fabric.</p>
