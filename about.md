> The Exploratory System Laboratory aims at Making Permissioned Blockchain Systems *Fast Again*.

ResilientDB makes system-centric design decisions by adopting a multi-thread architecture that encompasses deep-pipelines. Further, we separate the ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows us to perform out-of-order processing of messages.

      <p>Sadoghi's research spans all facets of secure and massive-scale data management. He leads the ExpoLab research group with the aim to pioneer a resilient data platform at scale, a distributed ledger centered around a democratic and decentralized computational model (Blockchain Textbook, ResilientDB Fabric, Journey, Outlook/Slides, Talk/Slides, Bitcoin Radio, Code, Hands-on, Wiki) that further aims to unify secure transactional and real-time analytical processing (Transaction Textbook, L-Store, QueCC). We envision ResilientDB to serve as a platform to foster "creativity". He has co-founded a blockchain company called Moka Blox, a spin-off of our ResilientDB Fabric.</p>

    <div class="item__description">
      <p>Previously, a Postdoc Scholar in the Exploratory Systems Lab, Prof. Jelle Hellings is now an Assistant Professor at McMaster University. His research centers around novel directions for high-performance large-scale data management systems. His research has a strong theoretical component (e.g., lower bound results, finite model theory, dependency theory) and a strong algorithmic component (e.g., external-memory algorithms, distributed algorithms, join algorithms). Currently, his focus is on the development of scalable resilient systems that can manage data and processing complex transactions, while providing strong guarantees toward users in the presence of faulty behavior (e.g., hardware failures, software failures, and malicious attacks).</p>
